        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A box of Annie's Mac 'N Cheese (farm animal shaped if possible)</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>1 Bratwurst</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pot of water to boil on the stove set to high heat. Set another burner to medium-high heat for a non-stick skillet.</li>
            <li>Cut your bratwurst vertically until it's split roughly 3/4 the way to one end. Make another cut intersecting the first cut. Make similar cuts as desired.</li>
            <li>Place a small slice of butter into the skillet and add the bratwurst. Remember to flip it after 3-4 minutes to get an even cook.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the water once it is boiling.</li>
            <li>Once the brat is a good and grilled (you can see if it's cooked thoroughly by examining the tentacles), remove it from the heat.</li>
            <li>Once the pasta has softened, drain the water and add 1/4 cup of milk, the cheese mix, and a 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
            <li>Mix the pasta until the cheese has reached a desireable consistency. Add the squid.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
